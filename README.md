Welcome to my **coding laboratory**. 

This repository acts as a collection of my algorithmic experiments, mini-games, and utility scripts. 

## Project Catalog

I have organized my scripts by category to document my learning path.

### Mini-Games
| Project | Description | Key Concepts Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Rock Paper Scissors](./games/rps.py)** | A CLI-based game against the computer. | `random` library, `while` loops, conditional logic. |
| **[Number Guessing](./games/guess_number.py)** | The computer generates a number, user guesses it. | Binary search intuition, input validation. |

### Math & Algorithms
| Project | Description | Key Concepts Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Odd/Even Finder](./math/odd_even.py)** | Identifies odd numbers in a list. | Modulo operator (`%`), list comprehension. |
| **[Fibonacci Generator](./math/fibonacci.py)** | Generates the sequence up to N. | Recursion vs. Iteration, basic optimization. |
| **[Prime Checker](./math/primes.py)** | Validates if a number is prime. | Loop efficiency (`sqrt` limit), boolean flags. |

### Utilities & Tools
| Project | Description | Key Concepts Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[File Renamer](./tools/renamer.py)** | Batch renames files in a directory. | `os` library, file I/O manipulation. |
| **[Password Gen](./tools/pass_gen.py)** | Creates strong random passwords. | String manipulation, ASCII constants. |
